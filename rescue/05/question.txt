Question:
You have learned how to add id and class attributes to an HTML
element. Can an HTML element contain both an id and a class value?
If so, provide an example of a style rule for the id and the class.

Answer:
Elements in HTML can use both a class and an id. In fact, I just
did this during my unit 1 project. Here is the CSS I used, as
well as an example of div elements using both a class and an id.

CSS:
.col{
	position: fixed;
	width: 30%;
	height: 100%;
	overflow-x: hidden;
	z-index: 1;
}
#left{
	left: 0;
	padding-left: 18%;
}
#right{
	right: 0;
	padding-right: 18%;
}

HTML:
<div class="col" id="left">
	<p>...
</div>
<div class="col" id="right">
	<p>...
</div>
