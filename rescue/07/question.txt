Question:
In this assignment, you created style rules for the aside,
figure, and figcaption elements. Discuss at least three
different declarations you would use to improve the
appearance of these elements.

Answer:

1. Shrink the figure element border:
figure{
	border: 2px solid #2A1F14;
}

2. Remove the text shadow from the figcaption element:
figcaption{
	text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px #000000;
}

3. Shrink the figcaption element top border:
figcaption{
	border-top: 3px solid #2A1F14;
}

4. Add a subtle padding to the figure element:
figure{
	padding: 0.3%;
}

5. Use a better looking font for the aside element:
aside{
	font-family: "Emblema One",system-ui;
}
